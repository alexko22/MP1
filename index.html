                    <p> Eager to learn and motivated final semester senior pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Boston University. Interested in Artificial Intelligence, Software Development, and finding creative ways to use technology. This summer I’ve had the opportunity to continue my AI journey as both a Generative AI Extern @ Cognizant and AI & Automation Extern @ Outamation (via Extern). I had the chance to dive into the world of game development as Extern @ Epic Games (via Extern), and am now developing my own platform, ExoCollect, after wrapping up a summer course in full-stack development. I am open to any and all opportunities following my graduation in the Fall 2025 semester. Feel free to connect! </p>
